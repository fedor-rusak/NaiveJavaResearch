# Simple bytecode interpreting

Java bytecode interpretatation is based on simple concepts like variables, operand stack, operation codes.

Yet there are funny things like calling methods, using constant pool values, passing parameters and getting results of method calling, specialframe handling logic. And I have said nothing about exception throwing/handling, or validating, or finding correct method for interface from all the alternatives, or instantiating object, or even arrays!

## Running

Just call this script:

```
interpret.bat
```
