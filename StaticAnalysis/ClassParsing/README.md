# Class parsing

This is a simple application that can parse compiled java classes and generated json-files with constant pool data from them.

So now we need to call this application on all files/folders from aggregation step and save result to one folder.

There is a simple node-script that uses separate batch script for calling java app to perform this task.

PS Don't know at the moment how to make it simpler.
