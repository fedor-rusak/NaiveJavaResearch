# Static Analysis

I want to have a simple toolchain for java code analysis.

First step is getting constant pool data from compiled java classes. And result is mirrored folder structure (of jar or folder) with JSON-files.

Second step is preparation for visualization. Here folder structure of each module has to be filtered from useless data and organized in final single-file format.

Third step is visualization. I am not sure yet on what level I should show dependencies between modules.
