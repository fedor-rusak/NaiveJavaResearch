# ANTLR v4 scaffolding

If you want to experiment with ANTLR v4 then you have to generate some files, folders and have some simple way to run the basic test.

I have implemented script *helper* which needs two parameters. It will produce folder with name of first parameter. That will have grammar with name of second parameter. Enjoy!
