# Hand-coded version of class file parser

This is my first attempt at parsing java class file structure.

## Running

It can be used by executing script:

```
parseJavaClassFile.bat
```

This will compile class HackMap and Test. After it HackMap will be called with HackMap.class as parameter and output will contain all the data about constants, methods, code, exception handlers and etc.
